Kernel Threads Module

Overview
This kernel module demonstrates how to create and manage multiple kernel threads in Linux. The module spawns two threads, each printing messages to the kernel log at regular intervals. It serves as an example for understanding the basics of kernel thread creation, execution, and termination.

Features

Creates two kernel threads ("thread1" and "thread2").

Each thread logs its activity to the kernel log ("dmesg").

Clean handling of thread lifecycle, including stopping threads during module removal.

File Details

Filename: "kernel_threads_module.c"

Module License: GPL

Author: Your Name

Version: 1.0

Thread Behavior

Thread 1:

Logs a message to the kernel every 2 seconds.

Thread 2:

Logs a message to the kernel every 3 seconds.

Run the command:
"make"

This will generate the ".ko" file for the module.

Usage
Loading the Module

Load the module into the kernel:
"sudo insmod kernel_threads_module.ko"

Verify that the module has been loaded:
"lsmod | grep kernel_threads_module"

Check the kernel log to see messages from the threads:
"dmesg | tail"

Unloading the Module

Unload the module:
"sudo rmmod kernel_threads_module"

Verify the module is removed:
"lsmod | grep kernel_threads_module"

Check the kernel log for cleanup messages:
"dmesg | tail"

Example Output
After loading the module, you should see messages like:
"[Module] Loading kernel module
[Thread 1] Starting thread 1
[Thread 2] Starting thread 2
[Thread 1] Hello from thread 1
[Thread 2] Hello from thread 2
...
[Module] Unloading kernel module
[Thread 1] Stopping thread 1
[Thread 2] Stopping thread 2
[Module] Kernel module unloaded successfully"

Notes

Use "dmesg" or "journalctl -k" to view kernel log messages.

Kernel modules run in privileged mode, so incorrect code can crash the system. Use caution when developing and testing.
